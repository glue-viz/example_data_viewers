# Mario Viewer

This demo uses data from this [YouTube Mario time trial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTiJaWCaKas). The dataset tracks many people
playing the same level of a Super Mario Bros. clone. The Data are provided
by Stabyourself.net and Maurice Guégan.

The data needed to run this demo are not included in this repository,
but instead can be downloaded here:
